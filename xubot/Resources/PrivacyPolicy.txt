Xubot Privacy Policy
Last updated on May 2nd, 2018

i. Output

What Xubot outputs is not filtered in any way. This includes content made from other users. I do not hold any
responsibility for what is returned that was created by another user.


I. General Use

Xubot does not use any data from the user and when the bot does it's temporary for the specific command, except for
the following outliers.


II. Markov Chains

Xubot uses a command input for the Markov inputs, and does not automatically add sentences from chat into the chain.

I understand that other bots take chat inputs into Markov chains, sometimes without discrimination, which the reason
I went with this design choice.


III. Adult Content

Any content that is adult and not safe for work is automatically restricted to channels marked as NSFW. However, there
is a toggle for individual server access, so *some* adult content is restricted unless a server administrator sets it.
This is to prevent servers that do not want *some* adult content can't be accessed.


IV. Moderation

The moderation commands are restricted to approriate roles, and there is no backdoor for unauthorized users. The bot
also needs the appropriate roles to do said actions.


V. XML Storage

Some commands store data in XML. This includes trusted users, pronouns, mood, and server triggers. The server triggers
and trusted users are nescessary for special functionalities. However, pronoun storage were for non-role functionality.
This functionality is planned to be completely phased out in following updates.

The data that is stored is elobrated below.


VI. Stored Data and What is Done With It

The data that is stored are as follows:
	- Your user ID
	- Your internal mood value
	- A server's join message
	- A server's NSFW lock
	- Your pronoun (to be removed)
