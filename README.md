## Building (.NET Framework)
Xubot uses WebSocket4Net to use connectivity on Windows 7.

Xubot is currently 64bit only. You may change it when building, however, you may come across memory issues.

Xubot requires some applications for some functionality. These include [a code interpeter (for the interp command)](xubot-code-compiler), and [a launcher and updater (for the update command and updates in general)](xubot-launcher).

The binary also depends on certain files within its directory. These can be found in the [config example](config-example) folder.

When forking for your own bot, ***follow the license.***

## Building (.NET Core)
N/A at current moment of time.
