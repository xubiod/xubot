### Build Status
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vxb9wvryyppa1cc5?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/xubiod/xubot)

## Building
When building xubot, you need to have a code handler! The official build uses [this application provided.](xubot-code-compiler)

Xubot uses WebSocket4Net to use connectivity on Windows 7, where the bot has been built in.

The application needs to read inputs, specifically language and code to use. A pre-made application is available [here](xubot-code-compiler).

The binary also depends on certain files within its directory. These can be found in the [config example](config-example) folder.

When forking for your own bot, ***follow the license.***
